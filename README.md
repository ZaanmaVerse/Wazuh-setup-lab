# 🔐 SIEM Integration Project: Wazuh + Suricata

This project demonstrates a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** solution using **Wazuh** as the Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) and **Suricata** as the Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS).

> 🎓 Developed as a student project to explore real-world threat monitoring and detection on a multi-VM lab environment.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Integrate **Wazuh** and **Suricata** for endpoint and network threat detection.
- Simulate real attacks using **Kali Linux** and observe detection in **Wazuh Dashboard**.
- Learn and apply best practices in security monitoring, event correlation, and alerting.

| Agent
v
+------------------+
| Wazuh Server |
| (Ubuntu Server) |
+------------------+

- **VM1**: Wazuh Server + Dashboard  
- **VM2**: Wazuh Agent (target machine)  
- **VM3**: Wazuh Agent + Suricata (NIDS sensor)  
- **VM4**: Kali Linux (attack simulator)

## ⚙️ How to Deploy

### 1. Clone this repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wazuh-suricata-project.git
cd wazuh-suricata-project
2. Configure Wazuh Agents
Install agent on VM2 and VM3

Register with Wazuh Manager using:
/var/ossec/bin/agent-auth -m <WAZUH_SERVER_IP>

3. Install & Configure Suricata on VM3
sudo apt update && sudo apt install suricata
sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i eth1

4. Forward Suricata Logs to Wazuh Agent
Edit ossec.conf on VM3 agent:

<localfile>
  <log_format>json</log_format>
  <location>/var/log/suricata/eve.json</location>
</localfile>

5. Access Wazuh Dashboard
Open your browser:

https://<WAZUH_SERVER_IP>
